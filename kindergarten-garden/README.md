# Instructions

* Clone this repository
* Import the project in the Eclipse IDE
* Find and right-click on the `KindergartenGardenTest`, select `Run As` >
  `JUnit Test`. See it fail.
* Find and edit `KindergartenGarden` so it passes the first test case the
  easiest and quickest way you can came up with ("shameless green").
* Execute the test cases again, and improve your solution until it passes and
  you are satisfied with the quality of your code.
* Include the next test case by removing its `@Ignore` line.
* Repeat until done.
